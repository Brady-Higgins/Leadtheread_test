1. Source fiction plots
2. Embed plots with ISBN and book title
3. You just created a database that'll outperform Google Books for plot based queries

--------
1. Sourcing Fiction plots
    a. Find names of a lot of fiction books 
       - OpenLibrary API : search by subject:Fiction then probably track page number, result number, etc.
       - Google Books : good alternative, not likely to go down
    b. plot search algorithm
        - check if wiki has the book (look into better wiki search)
        - 
        - ask chatgpt to generate a short plot description if it knows the book else ignore
2. Embed plots
    a. OpenAI embeddings and Pinecone Vector DB 
3. Query the DB
